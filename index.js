/*
create a function that uses the method find() to single out a specific result in game record data for the Denver Broncos football team. We want to find out if, at any point in the team's existence, they've had a win in the Superbowl. Our data looks like this:

const record = [
  { year: "2015", result: "W"},
  { year: "2014", result: "N/A"},
  { year: "2013", result: "L"},
  //...
]
Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
Each object has two properties: year and result
It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined
*/
function superbowlWin(yearResults) {
    const recordOfMostRecentWin = yearResults.find(yearResult => yearResult.result === 'W');
    if (recordOfMostRecentWin === undefined) return undefined;
    return recordOfMostRecentWin.year;
}
